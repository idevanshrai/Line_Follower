**Line Follower Robot**

This project aims to create a robot capable of autonomously following a path using an array sensor.

**Key Features:**
- **Array Sensor:** Detects the contrast between the path and its surroundings.
- **Line Following Algorithm:** Guides the robot to stay on the path by following the line.
- **Motor Control:** Uses motors for precise movement control.
- **Real-time Feedback:** Provides live feedback on sensor readings and movement actions for monitoring and debugging.

**Getting Started:**
1. **Assembly:** Follow the provided instructions to assemble the robot chassis, motors, wheels, and array sensor.
2. **Code Upload:** Use the Arduino IDE to upload the code to the Arduino Uno board.
3. **Testing:** Power on the robot and place it on the line. It should start following the path autonomously.
4. **Adjustments:** Modify the code or physical components if the robot deviates from the path.

**Future Plans:**
- **Obstacle Avoidance:** Implement an obstacle avoidance mechanism.
- **Speed Control:** Add speed control functionality for different sections of the path.
- **Path Optimization:** Optimize the algorithm for faster and more efficient path following.
